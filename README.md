## Project Structure

The project follows a basic class structure to represent players, ships, and boards. Here is a general overview of the classes:

- **Ship:** Represents a ship with properties such as length, orientation, and position.
- **Board:** Represents the game board with matrices for the visible and real boards.
- **Player:** Represents a player with a name, a board, and life points.

The game can be played in two modes:
- **Single Player:** Try to sink automatically generated ships on the board.
- **Two Players:** Players take turns shooting at each other's ships.
